# PatternPulse â€” Filtered Binary Tree & Pattern Matcher

## ğŸš€ What is PatternPulse?

**PatternPulse** is a Java project that builds and filters binary trees of string patterns, then uses advanced pattern matching techniques based on Abelian equality to detect complex pattern instances.  
Itâ€™s perfect for anyone interested in combinatorics on words, string algorithms, and theoretical computer science.

## âœ¨ Features

- ğŸ”¹ **Binary Tree Generator**  
  Builds a filtered binary tree of strings using two characters (e.g., "A" & "B"), pruning branches based on intricate pattern restrictions.

- ğŸ”¹ **Abelian Pattern Matcher**  
  Detects pattern instances not just by substring equality but by matching character counts (Abelian equality).

- ğŸ”¹ **Morphism-based String Growth**  
  Uses morphisms to generate strings by systematically replacing characters, enabling deep analysis of generated patterns.

- ğŸ”¹ **Organized Output**  
  Prints a clear tree structure and groups strings by length for easy visualization and debugging.
